# Example vault file - Copy this to vault.yml and encrypt it with ansible-vault
# To create an encrypted vault file:
#   1. Copy this file: cp vault.yml.example vault.yml
#   2. Edit vault.yml with your actual credentials
#   3. Encrypt it: ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/splunk_servers/vault.yml
#
# Or create and edit an encrypted file directly:
#   ansible-vault create group_vars/splunk_servers/vault.yml

# Splunk service account credentials
splunk_service_user: "splunk_svc"
splunk_service_password: "your_secure_password_here"

# Additional sensitive variables can be added here
# cert_password: "certificate_password"
# admin_password: "admin_password"
